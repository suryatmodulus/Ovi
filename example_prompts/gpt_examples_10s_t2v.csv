In the background, there's a stunning panoramic view of a city sprawling along a large body of water, with a long bridge and a distant statue visible under a bright, sunny sky. He begins on one knee, leaning back with one hand raised, then fluidly rises, bringing his hands to his head before dropping them down. He executes a quick succession of intricate footwork, shifting his weight rapidly and performing small hops and shuffles. His movements are sharp and precise, with a strong rhythmic quality. He bends his knees and extends his arms, then continues with more fast-paced footwork, incorporating body isolations and flowing arm movements. The dance is energetic and expressive, with the dancer's shadow stretching out behind him on the sunlit pavement. <S>Ovi diez segundos, mira cómo baila este algoritmo.<E> Audio: Upbeat, electronic dance music with a strong beat and synthesised elements, a processed, slightly robotic-sounding male voice speaking a Spanish phrase."

Utter chaos.<E> She pauses briefly, looking away, then back to the camera, her expression becoming more reflective as she continues, <S>Now this portrait gets a full ten seconds, and I still forgot to blink.<E> A slight grimace-like smile crosses her face, quickly transforming into a wide, joyful grin as she exclaims, <S>And I thought, wow, she survived the Ovi upgrade and looks great.<E> She smiles broadly, eyes sparkling, before speaking again with an enthusiastic, beaming expression, <S>So I immediately went down to the gift shop and bought the extended cut print.<E> Audio: A clear, articulate female voice speaking with a reflective, then amused and finally joyful tone.

She maintains a professional and friendly demeanor as she speaks, <S>A single five second clip can send markets crashing in minutes.<E> She slightly tilts her head as she continues, her expression thoughtful, <S>So what happens when Ovi gives that chaos ten seconds?

That's what you get in five seconds.<E> The woman smiles back, a hint of playful defiance in her eyes.
